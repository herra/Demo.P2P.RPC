# Demo.P2P.RPC

# Existing functionality
## Discovery & connection to local nodes
## JSON RPC ws communication between nodes
## Each node connects to all others that can be found with service discovery

# Missing 
## Some UI probably CLI - attempt to resolve with thread running UI actions
## Distributed transaction handling - research
## Auction actions(create, bid, complete) - depends on distributed transaction handling.
## Disconnection handling | Connection state

# Challanges
## Improve discovery mechanism 
## Separation of concerns in auction handling and node communication handling
## Distributed transaction handling
